3,1637223960.0,0,1,"To define lists in Python there are two ways. The first is to add your items between two square brackets.

Example:

items = [1, 2, 3, 4]
The 2nd method is to call the Python list built-in function by passing the items to it.

Example:

Items  = list(1, 2,3,4)
In both cases, the output will be

[1, 2, 3, 4]
The list can accept any data type. You can have a list of integers and strings. List in python doesn't enforce to have a single item type in it. You can have a list of different items.

[1, 'name', {""key"" : ""value""}, list(1, 2, 3)]
This gives you the flexibility to add multiple data types in the list. You can add a list inside this list. This is called a nested list. Now we store our data into a python list it's time to know how to do more with these data.",Screenshot 2021-11-18 at 09.25.27.png

I don't know whether or not you are using any WKWebView plugins, but the cordova-wkwebview-engine plugin supports some iOS specific Application Transport Security settings as well https://github.com/apache/cordova-plugin-wkwebview-engine.

Another workaround would be to use an HTML input tag to initiate the camera capture:

<input type=""file"" capture=""camera"" accept=""image/*"" />
And just listen to the ""change"" event.",

You should avoid using list as a variable name, it's a reserved word for python lists.

I think this is what you want:

list_ = []
f_list = []

item = [1,2,3,4,5]

for i in item:
    list_.append(i)
    f_list.extend(list_)
    print(list_)
print(""Final list - "", f_list)
Output:

[1]
[1, 2]
[1, 2, 3]
[1, 2, 3, 4]
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Final list -  [1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]",Screenshot 2021-11-18 at 09.35.15.png

If you import the guardless script in another script (e.g. import my_script_without_a_name_eq_main_guard), then the second script will trigger the first to run at import time and using the second script's command line arguments. This is almost always a mistake.

Long Answer

To better understand why and how this matters, we need to take a step back to understand how Python initializes scripts and how this interacts with its module import mechanism.

Whenever the Python interpreter reads a source file, it does two things:

it sets a few special variables like __name__, and then
it executes all of the code found in the file.
Let's see how this works and how it relates to your question about the __name__ checks we always see in Python scripts.
